# tic-tac-toe

I've created this Tic Tac Toe game as a part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript course. 

The goal of the project was to start working with objects, modules and factory functions, and to have as little code outside of objects as possible. I've kept all functions and variables within an object as a result and have no variables lying around "loose" in my code.

The game can be played against another player (sharing the screen) or versus the computer. For the AI, two move selection options were created: one selecting a random available move, and one selecting the optimal move for the AI through a minimax algorithm. Depending on which of the four difficulty levels you choose, there is a 0%, 33%, 67% or 100% chance that the AI chooses the optimal move.
